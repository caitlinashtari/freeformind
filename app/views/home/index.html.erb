  <h6>We're Freeformind, and we're glad you're here. We design charms and ornaments inspired by places and objects people love. We create our products using small-batch manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing, lost wax casting, and photo-etching. We seek to propel interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. We geek out on architecture and 3D printing, and it inspires us to create intricate shapes that can't be manufactured through traditional casting processes. Our products can be found online, in museum stores, and boutique gift shops throughout the US. Freeformind was established in 2014 in Emeryville, Ca.</h6>
